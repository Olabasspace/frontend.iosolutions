## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt about the transform style in CSS.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
body{
    transform: translate(50%, 50%);
    position: absolute;
    display: flex;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to learn more about CSS styling.
